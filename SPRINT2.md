# Sprint 2: Gameplay Testing & Python Foundation

## Goals
1. **Play Testing** (Gus leading)
   - Document core gameplay mechanics
   - Test save/load functionality
   - Identify bugs in current implementation
   - Create baseline for feature additions

2. **Python Wrapper Design** (Rahul leading)
   - Evaluate approaches:
     - Direct ctypes binding to C++
     - WebAssembly bridge via pyodide
     - Subprocess with command interface
   - Create initial prototype
   - Design API for game state access

3. **Test Infrastructure** (Maya leading)
   - Extend JavaScript API for testing
   - Create automated gameplay tests
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Add regression tests for our bug fixes

4. **Feature Preparation**
   - Map out shop system architecture
   - Design rumors/dialogue system
   - Plan color scheme for Wizard mode
   - Research multiplayer possibilities?
